### Mentor meeting 1 
- Project Mentor: Robin Swanson
- 30th November 2022

### Notes
- Downsample original image to size 64 for training
- Increase training time
- Reduce model complexity, need smaller latent vector
- Upsample this image or Downsample original image for comparison
- Try getting images comparable to the paper then meet again
- We could write we did not have enough time and resources for hyperparameter tuning
