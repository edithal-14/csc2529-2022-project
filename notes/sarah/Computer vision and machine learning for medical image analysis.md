Computer vision and machine learning for medical image analysis: recent advances, challenges, and way forward

Applications:
Clinical uses of DL: skin cancer classification in dermoscopic images, lung cancer identification in CT images, breast cancer classification in mammograms and ultrasound images, brain cancer classification in MRI images, chest CT images, diabetic retinopathy, eye disease recognition in retinal fundus images,  colon cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer, and COVID infections in the chest X-ray images.

Models:
DL methods for object detection and recognition: Faster Region-based CNN, single shot detectors, region-based fully convolutional networks, YOLO. YOLO is considered among the fastest object recognition methods, however, R-CNN is often more accurate.

In contrast to single-stage object detection techniques, two-stage detection techniques produce a group of regions of interest (ROIs) where a complete object is likely to be found, and recognises each of them. FasterRCNN and Mask-RCNN are commonly used examples of the two-stage detection techniques.

U-Net with a generative adversarial network was applied to segment the whole heart from the CT images. An automatic, self-attention based lung segmentation model was proposed for chest X-rays. A mechanism was utilized for brain tumor segmentation in MRI multi-modalities brain images. The conditional generative adversarial network is used to segment skin and breast lesions.
